&lt;p>In most cases kidney disease will directly impact the rest of a person’s life. This can take its toll both physically and emotionally, inevitably individuals, their families and carers may need the support of charities such as the LKPA, which is run entirely by volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Money raised is used to provide welfare assistance for patients, member events and small grants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All donations are greatly appreciated and help us to continue to provide support and guidance throughout this uncertain time. Please donate to help us to continue to fund our vital services, we need your support now more than ever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fund Raising</title><link>https://lkpa.uk/post/fundraising/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lkpa.uk/post/fundraising/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://lkpa.uk/images/cake-stand2.jpg"
