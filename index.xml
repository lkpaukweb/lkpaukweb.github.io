      <description>Please Donate In most cases kidney disease will directly impact the rest of a personâ€™s life. This can take its toll both physically and emotionally, inevitably individuals, their families and carers may need the support of charities such as the LKPA, which is run entirely by volunteers.&#xA;Money raised is used to provide welfare assistance for patients and small grants.&#xA;All donations are greatly appreciated and help us to continue to provide support and guidance throughout this uncertain time.</description>
